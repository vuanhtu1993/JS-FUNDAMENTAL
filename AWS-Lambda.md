## AWS Lambda
Run code without thinking about servers. Pay only for the compute time you consume.
## Use cases
### 1. Data processing
>You can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response to triggers such as changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by users.
>Lambda can be directly triggered by AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SNS, and CloudWatch, or it can be orchestrated into workflows by AWS Step Functions.
>This allows you to build a variety of real-time serverless data processing systems.
- REAL-TIME FILE PROCESSING
You can use Amazon S3 to trigger AWS Lambda to process data immediately after an upload.
For example, you can use Lambda to thumbnail images, transcode videos, index files, process logs,
validate content, and aggregate and filter data in real-time.
